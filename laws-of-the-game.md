Introduction

The philosophy and
spirit of the Laws
 ootball is the greatest sport on earth. It is played in every country and at many
F
different levels. The Laws of the Game are the same for all football throughout
the world from the FIFA World Cup™ Final through to a game between young
children in a remote village.
 hat the same Laws apply in every match in every confederation, country,
T
town and village throughout the world is a considerable strength which must
be preserved. This is also an opportunity which must be harnessed for the
good of football everywhere.

 ootball must have Laws which keep the game ‘fair’ as a crucial foundation of
F
the beauty of the ‘beautiful game’ is its fairness – this is a vital feature of the
‘spirit’ of the game. The best matches are those where the referee is rarely
needed as the players play with respect for each other, the match officials and
the Laws.
 he integrity of the Laws, and the referees who apply them, must always be
T
protected and respected. All those in authority, especially coaches and team
captains, have a clear responsibility to the game to respect the match officials
and their decisions.

Managing changes
to the Laws
 he first ‘universal’ football Laws were drawn up in 1863 and in 1886
T
The International Football Association Board (The IFAB) was founded by the
four British football associations (The FA, Scottish FA, FA of Wales and Irish FA)
as the worldwide body with sole responsibility for developing and preserving
the Laws of the Game. FIFA joined The IFAB in 1913.
 or a Law to be changed, The IFAB must be convinced that the change will
F
benefit the game. This means that the potential change will usually be tested,
as with red and yellow cards for team officials and the new goal kick and
substitution procedures. For every proposed change, focus must be on:
fairness, integrity, respect, safety, the enjoyment of the participants and how
technology can benefit the game. The Laws must also encourage participation
from everyone, regardless of background or ability.

 lthough accidents occur, the Laws should make the game as safe as possible.
A
This requires players to show respect for their opponents and referees should
create a safe environment by dealing strongly with those whose play is too
aggressive and dangerous. The Laws embody the unacceptability of unsafe play
in their disciplinary phrases, e.g. ‘reckless challenge’ (caution = yellow card/
YC) and ‘endangering the safety of an opponent’ or ‘using excessive force’
(sending-off = red card/RC).

12

 ootball must be attractive and enjoyable for players, match officials, coaches,
F
as well as spectators, fans, administrators etc. The Laws must help make the
game attractive and enjoyable so people, regardless of age, race, religion,
culture, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, disability etc. want to take part
and enjoy their involvement with football.

 ootball’s Laws are relatively simple, compared to other team sports, but as
F
many situations are ‘subjective’ and referees are human (and thus make
mistakes) some decisions will inevitably cause debate and discussion.
For some people, this discussion is part of the game’s enjoyment and attraction
but, whether decisions are right or wrong, the ‘spirit’ of the game requires that
referees’ decisions are always respected.
 he Laws cannot deal with every possible situation, so where there is no direct
T
provision in the Laws, The IFAB expects the referee to make a decision within
the ‘spirit’ of the game – this often involves asking the question, “what would
football want/expect?”
 he IFAB will continue to engage with the global football family so changes to
T
the Laws benefit football at all levels and in every corner of the world, and so
the integrity of the game, the Laws and the referees is respected, valued and
protected.

Background to
the 2019/20 revision
of the Laws
 he 2016/17 revision of the Laws of the Game started the most far-reaching
T
and comprehensive period of Law changes in The IFAB’s history. The aim is to
make the Laws clearer, more accessible and to ensure they reflect the needs of
the modern game at all levels.

 any of the changes are the result of suggestions from individuals, groups and
M
national FAs from around the world which have been reviewed by The IFAB’s
Football and Technical Advisory Panels to ensure that all areas of football
contribute to the evolution of the Laws, as the Laws are for everyone involved
in the game, not just the referees.
 he most recent changes have extended many of the principles established in
T
the 2016/17 revision and, as outlined in the ‘play fair!’ strategy, have tried to
improve the game’s attractiveness and the levels of behaviour. In this context,
the 2017 AGM approved some significant changes to help develop the lower
levels of football, including:
• e xtending the flexibility of national FAs to modify some of the
‘organisational’ Laws to help promote football in their countries
• introducing the option to use temporary dismissals (sin bins) as an
alternative sanction to a caution (YC) in youth, veterans, disability and
grassroots (lowest levels) football
• extending the use of return substitutes to youth, veterans and disability
football (they are already permitted in grassroots football).

14

I n March 2018, The IFAB AGM approved a further series of changes, the two
most significant of which were competition options allowing an additional
substitute in extra time and the use of video assistant referees (VARs).

 he option to use an additional substitute in extra time has benefited football
T
at all levels as the extra ‘fresh’ player can both save another player from the
possibility of exhaustion/injury and increase the chances of the game being
decided in extra time.

 he introduction of VARs has been the biggest revolution in professional
T
football for more than a century. Given that it took football many years of
debate before it took the tentative steps to see if technology could assist
decision-making without destroying the game’s almost non-stop flow of action
and emotion, it has been a remarkably fast ‘revolution’.
 he first VAR match took place in New Jersey, NY, USA on 12 August 2016 and,
T
remarkably, only 23 months later, VARs were being used in the 2018 FIFA
World Cup™ final in Moscow. VARs will never solve every ‘dispute’, as so many
decisions are subjective, but its adoption by most of the world’s major
footballing countries demonstrates that football believes that VARs bring
greater fairness and improve player behaviour.

 any of the Law changes for 2019/20 will directly and positively affect the way
M
the game is played and its image, e.g.:
• m
 ore constructive play at goal kicks as the ball no longer has to the leave the
penalty area before it can be played
Laws of th e Game 2 019/20 | Introduc tion

15

• a ttacking players will not be allowed into the defensive ‘wall’ to cause
disruption and conflict (which also delays the game)
• a fairer dropped ball procedure will stop the current ‘abuses’ – a dropped
ball will also be given if the ball hits the referee and goes into the goal, the
team in possession changes, or a new attack begins

 s part of The IFAB’s on-going determination to use the Laws to improve
A
behaviour and the image of the game, misbehaving team officials will now
receive a yellow or red card and, if the offender cannot be identified, the senior
coach will get the card.

 he IFAB will continue to experiment with significant Law changes. Most of the
T
experiments so far have been successful but the so-called ‘AB-BA’ system of
kicks from the penalty mark – where the team taking the 2nd kick alternated
– proved not to be especially popular, primarily because it was complicated and
football is essentially a simple (and traditional!) game, so it has been
discontinued.

16

17

The future
 he IFAB’s ‘play fair!’ strategy for 2017-22 was established to examine and
T
consider proposed changes to see if they will benefit the game. It has been
well-received throughout the football world and there has been strong
approval of its focus on three important areas:

•• Fairness and integrity
••will the proposed change strengthen the game’s fairness and integrity on
the field of play?
•• Universality and inclusion
••will the proposed change benefit football at all levels throughout the
world?
••will the proposed change encourage more people from all backgrounds
and abilities to take part in and enjoy football?
•• The growth of technology
••will the proposed change have a positive impact on the game?
 he IFAB, working with its expert panels, will continue to consult widely on a
T
number of important Law-related topics, including player behaviour and
potentially enhancing the role of the captain.

 y focussing on fairness, universality and inclusion, and technology, The IFAB
B
will continue to develop the Laws to promote a better game on every football
field in every part of the world.
 he significant Law changes in recent years have begun to make a major
T
contribution to increasing playing time, fairness and the attractiveness of the
game. Along with the impact of VARs, player behaviour is also expected to
continue to improve. All this will make the game even more enjoyable to play,
watch and referee.

18

The IFAB greatly enjoys engaging with people throughout the world and we are
always very pleased and interested to receive suggestions or questions relating
to the Laws of the Game. Indeed, many of the recent Law changes have come
from suggestions from people from many different parts of the world.

Notes
on the Laws
of the Game

Official languages
The IFAB publishes the Laws of the Game in English, French, German
and Spanish. If there is any divergence in the wording, the English text is
authoritative.

Other languages
National FAs which translate the Laws of the Game can obtain the layout
template for the 2019/20 edition of the Laws from The IFAB by contacting:
info@theifab.com.

 ational FAs which produce a translated version of the Laws of the Game
N
using this format are invited to send a copy to The IFAB (stating clearly on
the front cover that it is that national FA’s official translation) so it can be
posted on The IFAB website for use by others.

Applying the Laws
The same Laws apply in every match in every confederation, country,
town and village and, apart from the Modifications permitted by The IFAB
(see ‘Modifications to the Laws’), the Laws must not be modified or changed,
except with the permission of The IFAB.
 hose who are educating match officials and other participants, should
T
emphasise that:

• r eferees should apply the Laws within the ‘spirit’ of the game to help
produce fair and safe matches
• e veryone must respect the match officials and their decisions, remembering
and respecting that referees are human and will make mistakes
 layers have a major responsibility for the image of the game and the team
P
captain should play an important role in helping to ensure that the Laws and
referees’ decisions are respected.

Modifications
to the Laws


The
universality of the Laws of the Game means that the game is essentially
the same in every part of the world and at every level. As well as creating a
‘fair’ and safe environment in which the game is played, the Laws should also
promote participation and enjoyment.

 istorically, The IFAB has allowed national football associations (FAs) some
H
flexibility to modify the ‘organisational’ Laws for specific categories of football.
However, The IFAB strongly believes that national FAs should be given more
options to modify aspects of the way football is organised if it will benefit
football in their own country.

 ow the game is played and refereed should be the same on every football field
H
in the world from the FIFA World Cup™ final to the smallest village. However,
the needs of a country’s domestic football should determine how long the game
lasts, how many people can take part and how some unfair behaviour is
punished.

 onsequently, the 131st AGM of The IFAB held in London on 3rd March 2017
C
unanimously agreed that national FAs (and confederations and FIFA) now have
the option to modify all or some of the following organisational areas of the
Laws of the Game for football for which they are responsible:
For youth, veterans, disability and grassroots football:
•
•
•
•

size of the field of play
size, weight and material of the ball
width between the goalposts and height of the crossbar from the ground
duration of the two (equal) halves of the game (and two equal halves of
extra time)
• the use of return substitutes
• the use of temporary dismissals (sin bins) for some/all cautions (YCs)

Laws of th e Game 2 019/20 | Modific ations to the Laws

25

 or any level except competitions involving the 1st team of clubs in the top
F
division or ‘A’ international teams:
• the number of substitutions each team is permitted to use up to a
maximum of five, except in youth football where the maximum will be
determined by the national FA, confederation or FIFA

I n addition, to allow national FAs further flexibility to benefit and develop their
domestic football, The IFAB AGM approved the following changes relating to
‘categories’ of football:
• women’s football is no longer a separate category and now has the same
status as men’s football
• the age limits for youth and veterans have been removed – national FAs,
confederations and FIFA have the flexibility to decide the age restrictions
for these categories
• each national FA will determine which competitions at the lowest levels of
football are designated as ‘grassroots’ football

Permission for other modifications
National FAs have the option to approve different modifications for different
competitions - there is no requirement to apply them universally or to apply
them all. However, no other modifications are allowed without the permission of
The IFAB.

 ational FAs are asked to inform The IFAB of their use of these modifications,
N
and at which levels, as this information, and especially the reason(s) why the
modifications are being used, may identify development ideas/strategies which
The IFAB can share to assist the development of football in other national FAs.
 he IFAB would also be very interested to hear about other potential
T
modifications of the Laws of the Game which could increase participation,
make football more attractive and promote its worldwide development.

Guidelines for
temporary dismissals
(sin bins)
The 131st AGM of The IFAB held in London on 3rd March 2017 approved the use
of temporary dismissals (sin bins) for all or some cautions/yellow cards (YCs)
in youth, veterans, disability and grassroots football, subject to the approval of
the competition’s national FA, confederation or FIFA, whichever is appropriate.
Reference to temporary dismissals is found in:
Law 5 – The Referee (Powers and duties):
Disciplinary action

 he referee has the power to show yellow or red cards and, where competition
T
rules permit, temporarily dismiss a player, from entering the field at the start
of the match until after the match has ended, including during the half-time
interval, extra time and kicks from the penalty mark.

 temporary dismissal is when a player commits a cautionable (YC) offence and
A
is punished by an immediate ‘suspension’ from participating in the next part of
that match. The philosophy is that an ‘instant punishment’ can have a
significant and immediate positive influence on the behaviour of the offending
player and, potentially, the player’s team.

The national FA, confederation or FIFA should approve (for publication in
the competition rules) a temporary dismissal protocol within the following
guidelines:

28

Players only
• T
 emporary dismissals apply to all players (including goalkeepers) but not for
cautionable offences (YCs) committed by a substitute or substituted player
Referee’s signal
• T
 he referee will indicate a temporary dismissal by showing a yellow card
(YC) and then clearly pointing with both arms to the temporary dismissal
area (usually the player’s technical area)

The temporary dismissal period
• The length of the temporary dismissal is the same for all offences
• T
 he length of the temporary dismissal should be between 10–15% of the
total playing time (e.g. 10 minutes in a 90-minute match; 8 minutes in an
80-minute match)
• T
 he temporary dismissal period begins when play restarts after the player
has left the field of play
• T
 he referee should include in the temporary dismissal period any time ‘lost’
for a stoppage for which ‘additional time’ will be allowed at the end of the
half (e.g. substitution, injury etc...)
• C
 ompetitions must decide who will help the referee time the dismissal
period – it could be the responsibility of a delegate, 4th official or neutral
assistant referee; conversely it could be a team official
• Once the temporary dismissal period has been completed, the player can
return from the touchline with the referee’s permission, which can be given
while the ball is in play
• The referee has the final decision as to when the player can return
• A temporarily dismissed player can not be substituted until the end of the
temporary dismissal period (but not if the team has used all its permitted
substitutes)
• If a temporary dismissal period has not been completed at the end of
the first half (or the end of the second half when extra time is to be played)
the remaining part of the temporary dismissal period is served from the start
of the second half (start of extra time)
• A player who is still serving a temporary dismissal at the end of the match is
permitted to take part in kicks from the penalty mark (penalties)
Laws of th e Game 2 019/20 | Modific ations to the Laws

29

Temporary dismissal area
• A temporarily dismissed player should remain within the technical area
(where one exists) or with the team’s coach/technical staff, unless ‘warming
up’ (under the same conditions as a substitute)
Offences during a temporary dismissal
• A temporarily dismissed player who commits a cautionable (YC) or
sending-off (RC) offence during their temporary dismissal period will take
no further part in the match and may not be replaced or substituted

Further disciplinary action
• Competitions/national FAs will decide if temporary dismissals must be
reported to the appropriate authorities and whether any further disciplinary
action may be taken e.g. suspension for accumulating a number of temporary
dismissals, as with cautions (YCs)
Temporary dismissal systems
A competition may use one of the following temporary dismissal systems:
• System A – for all cautions (YCs)
• System B – for some but not all cautions (YCs)

System A – temporary dismissal for all cautions (YCs)
• All cautions (YCs) are punished with a temporary dismissal
• A player who receives a second caution (YC) in the same match:

••will receive a second temporary dismissal and then takes no further part
in the match
••may be replaced by a substitute at the end of the second temporary
dismissal period if the player’s team has not used its maximum number
of substitutes (this is because the team has already been ‘punished’ by
playing without that player for 2 x temporary dismissal periods)

30

System B – temporary dismissal for some but not all cautions (YCs)*
• A
 pre-defined list of cautionable (YC) offences will be punished by a
temporary dismissal
• A
 ll other cautionable offences are punished with a caution (YC)
• A
 player who has been temporarily dismissed and then receives a caution
(YC) continues playing
• A
 player who has received a caution (YC) and then receives a temporary
dismissal can continue playing after the end of the temporary
dismissal period
• A player who receives a second temporary dismissal in the same match will
serve the temporary dismissal and then takes no further part in the match.
The player may be replaced by a substitute at the end of the second
temporary dismissal period if the player’s team has not used its maximum
number of substitutes but a player who has also received a non-temporary
dismissal caution (YC) may not be replaced or substituted
• A player who receives a second caution (YC) in the same match will be sent
off and takes no further part in the match and may not be replaced/
substituted
* Some competitions may find it valuable to use temporary dismissals only for
cautions (YCs) for offences relating to ‘inappropriate’ behaviour, e.g.

•
•
•
•
•

Simulation
Deliberately delaying the opposing team’s restart of the match
Dissent or verbal comments or gestures
Stopping a promising attack by holding, pulling, pushing or handball
Kicker illegally feinting at a penalty kick

Guidelines for
return substitutes
 ollowing approval at the 131st AGM of The IFAB held in London on 3rd March
F
2017 the Laws of the Game now permit the use of return substitutes in youth,
veterans, disability and grassroots football, subject to the approval of the
competition’s national FA, confederation or FIFA, whichever is appropriate.
Reference to return substitutions is found in:

Law 3 – The Players (Number of substitutions):
Return substitutions

• T
 he use of return substitutions is only permitted in youth, veterans,
disability and grassroots football, subject to the agreement of the national
football association, confederation or FIFA.

 ‘return substitute’ is a player who has already played in the match and has
A
been substituted (a substituted player) and later in the match returns to play
by replacing another player.

 part from the dispensation for a substituted player to return to play in the
A
match, all other provisions of Law 3 and the Laws of the Game apply to return
substitutes. In particular, the substitution procedure outlined in Law 3
must be followed.

The Field of Play
1. Field surface
The field of play must be a wholly natural or, if competition rules permit,
a wholly artificial playing surface except where competition rules permit an
integrated combination of artificial and natural materials (hybrid system).
The colour of artificial surfaces must be green.

 here artificial surfaces are used in competition matches between
W
representative teams of national football associations affiliated to FIFA or
international club competition matches, the surface must meet the
requirements of the FIFA Quality Programme for Football Turf or the
International Match Standard, unless special dispensation is given by The IFAB.

2. Field markings
The field of play must be rectangular and marked with continuous lines which
must not be dangerous; artificial playing surface material may be used for the
field markings on natural fields if it is not dangerous. These lines belong to the
areas of which they are boundaries.
 nly the lines indicated in Law 1 are to be marked on the field of play. Where
O
artificial surfaces are used, other lines are permitted provided they are a
different colour and clearly distinguishable from the football lines.
 he two longer boundary lines are touchlines. The two shorter lines are
T
goal lines.

 he field of play is divided into two halves by a halfway line, which joins the
T
midpoints of the two touchlines.

 he centre mark is at the midpoint of the halfway line. A circle with a radius
T
of 9.15 m (10 yds) is marked around it.

The Referee
1. The authority of the referee
Each match is controlled by a referee who has full authority to enforce
the Laws of the Game in connection with the match.

2. Decisions of the referee
Decisions will be made to the best of the referee's ability according to the Laws
of the Game and the ‘spirit of the game’ and will be based on the opinion of the
referee, who has the discretion to take appropriate action within the
framework of the Laws of the Game.

 he decisions of the referee regarding facts connected with play, including
T
whether or not a goal is scored and the result of the match, are final. The
decisions of the referee, and all other match officials, must always be respected.
 he referee may not change a restart decision on realising that it is incorrect or
T
on the advice of another match official if play has restarted or the referee has
signalled the end of the first or second half (including extra time) and left the
field of play or abandoned the match. However, if at the end of the half, the
referee leaves the field of play to go to the referee review area (RRA) or to
instruct the players to return to the field of play, this does not prevent a
decision being changed for an incident which occurred before the end of the
half.
 xcept as outlined in Law 12.3 and the VAR protocol, a disciplinary sanction
E
may only be issued after play has restarted if another match official had
identified and attempted to communicate the offence to the referee before play
restarted; the restart associated with the sanction does not apply.

The Start and
Restart of Play
 kick-off starts both halves of a match, both halves of extra time and restarts
A
play after a goal has been scored. Free kicks (direct or indirect), penalty kicks,
throw-ins, goal kicks and corner kicks are other restarts (see Laws 13–17).
A dropped ball is the restart when the referee stops play and the Law does not
require one of the above restarts.
I f an offence occurs when the ball is not in play, this does not change how
play is restarted.

1. Kick-off
Procedure
• t he team that wins the toss of a coin decides which goal to attack in
the first half or to take the kick-off
• depending on the above, their opponents take the kick-off or decide which
goal to attack in the first half
• the team that decided which goal to attack in the first half takes the kick-off
to start the second half
• for the second half, the teams change ends and attack the opposite goals
• after a team scores a goal, the kick-off is taken by their opponents
For every kick-off:

• a ll players, except the player taking the kick-off, must be in their own half
of the field of play
• the opponents of the team taking the kick-off must be at least 9.15 m
(10 yds) from the ball until it is in play
• the ball must be stationary on the centre mark
• the referee gives a signal
• the ball is in play when it is kicked and clearly moves
Laws of th e Game 2 019/20 | Law 08 | The Start and Res tart of P l ay

87

• a goal may be scored directly against the opponents from the kick-off; if the
ball directly enters the kicker’s goal, a corner kick is awarded to the opponents

Offences and sanctions
If the player taking the kick-off touches the ball again before it has touched
another player, an indirect free kick, or for a handball offence, a direct free kick,
is awarded.
In the event of any other kick-off procedure offence, the kick-off is retaken.

2. Dropped ball
Procedure
• The ball is dropped for the defending team goalkeeper in their penalty area
if, when play was stopped:
••the ball was in the penalty area or
••the last touch of the ball was in the penalty area

• I n all other cases, the referee drops the ball for one player of the team that
last touched the ball at the position where it last touched a player, an outside
agent or, as outlined in Law 9.1, a match official
• A
 ll other players (of both teams) must remain at least 4 m (4.5 yds) from the
ball until it is in play
The ball is in play when it touches the ground.
Offences and sanctions
The ball is dropped again if it:

• touches a player before it touches the ground
• leaves the field of play after it touches the ground, without touching a player
I f a dropped ball enters the goal without touching at least two players, play is
restarted with:
• a goal kick if it enters the opponents’ goal
• a corner kick if it enters the team’s goal

Law

The Ball In and
Out of Play
1. Ball out of play
The ball is out of play when:

• it has wholly passed over the goal line or touchline on the ground or
in the air
• play has been stopped by the referee
• it touches a match official, remains on the field of play and:
••a team starts a promising attack or
••the ball goes directly into the goal or
••the team in possession of the ball changes

In all these cases, play is restarted with a dropped ball.

2. Ball in play
The ball is in play at all other times when it touches a match official and when
it rebounds off a goalpost, crossbar or corner flagpost and remains on the field
of play.

Determining the
Outcome of a Match
1. Goal scored
A goal is scored when the whole of the ball passes over the goal line, between
the goalposts and under the crossbar, provided that no offence has been
committed by the team scoring the goal.

I f the goalkeeper throws the ball directly into the opponents’ goal, a goal kick is
awarded.
I f a referee signals a goal before the ball has passed wholly over the goal line,
play is restarted with a dropped ball.

2. Winning team
The team scoring the greater number of goals is the winner. If both teams score
no goals or an equal number of goals, the match is drawn.
 hen competition rules require a winning team after a drawn match or homeW
and-away tie, the only permitted procedures to determine the winning team
are:
• away goals rule
• two equal periods of extra time not exceeding 15 minutes each
• kicks from the penalty mark
A combination of the above procedures may be used.

3. Kicks from the penalty mark
Kicks from the penalty mark are taken after the match has ended and unless
otherwise stated, the relevant Laws of the Game apply.

Procedure
Before kicks from the penalty mark start
• U
 nless there are other considerations (e.g. ground conditions, safety etc.),
the referee tosses a coin to decide the goal at which the kicks will be taken
which may only be changed for safety reasons or if the goal or playing
surface becomes unusable
• The referee tosses a coin again, and the team that wins the toss decides
whether to take the first or second kick
• With the exception of a substitute for a goalkeeper who is unable to continue,
only players who are on the field of play or are temporarily off the field of
play (injury, adjusting equipment etc.) at the end of the match are eligible to
take kicks
• Each team is responsible for selecting from the eligible players the order in
which they will take the kicks. The referee is not informed of the order
• If at the end of the match and before or during the kicks one team has a
greater number of players than its opponents, it must reduce its numbers to
the same number as its opponents and the referee must be informed of the
name and number of each player excluded. Any excluded player is not eligible
to take part in the kicks (except as outlined below)
• A goalkeeper who is unable to continue before or during the kicks may be
replaced by a player excluded to equalise the number of players or, if their
team has not used its maximum permitted number of substitutes, a named
substitute, but the replaced goalkeeper takes no further part and may not
take a kick
• If the goalkeeper has already taken a kick, the replacement may not take a
kick until the next round of kicks
During kicks from the penalty mark

• O
 nly eligible players and match officials are permitted to remain on the field
of play
• All eligible players, except the player taking the kick and the two
goalkeepers, must remain within the centre circle

95

• T
 he goalkeeper of the kicker must remain on the field of play, outside the
penalty area, on the goal line where it meets the penalty area boundary line
• An eligible player may change places with the goalkeeper
• The kick is completed when the ball stops moving, goes out of play or the
referee stops play for any offence; the kicker may not play the ball a second time
• The referee keeps a record of the kicks
• If the goalkeeper commits an offence and, as a result, the kick is retaken,
the goalkeeper must be cautioned
• If the kicker is penalised for an offence committed after the referee has
signalled for the kick to be taken, that kick is recorded as missed and the
kicker is cautioned
• If both the goalkeeper and kicker commit an offence at the same time:
••if the kick is missed or saved, the kick is retaken and both players
cautioned
••if the kick is scored, the goal is disallowed, the kick is recorded as missed
and the kicker cautioned

Subject to the conditions explained below, both teams take five kicks

• The kicks are taken alternately by the teams
• Each kick is taken by a different player, and all eligible players must take a
kick before any player can take a second kick
• If, before both teams have taken five kicks, one has scored more goals than
the other could score, even if it were to complete its five kicks, no more kicks
are taken
• If, after both teams have taken five kicks, the scores are level, kicks continue
until one team has scored a goal more than the other from the same number
of kicks
• The above principle continues for any subsequent sequence of kicks but a
team may change the order of kickers
• Kicks from the penalty mark must not be delayed for a player who leaves the
field of play. The player’s kick will be forfeited (not scored) if the player does
not return in time to take a kick

96

Substitutions and sending-offs during kicks from the penalty mark
• A player, substitute or substituted player may be cautioned or sent off
• A goalkeeper who is sent off must be replaced by an eligible player
• A
 player other than the goalkeeper who is unable to continue may not
be replaced
• The referee must not abandon the match if a team is reduced to fewer than
seven players

• last two opponents

2. Offside offence
A player in an offside position at the moment the ball is played or touched*
by a team-mate is only penalised on becoming involved in active play by:
• interfering with play by playing or touching a ball passed or touched by
a team-mate or
• interfering with an opponent by:

opponent to play the ball

• g aining an advantage by playing the ball or interfering with an opponent
when it has:

••rebounded or been deflected off the goalpost, crossbar, match official or
an opponent
••been deliberately saved by any opponent

A
deliberately plays the ball (except from a deliberate save by any opponent) is
not considered to have gained an advantage.

 ‘save’ is when a player stops, or attempts to stop, a ball which is going into or
A
very close to the goal with any part of the body except the hands/arms (unless
the goalkeeper within the penalty area).
In situations where:

• a player moving from, or standing in, an offside position is in the way of an
opponent and interferes with the movement of the opponent towards the ball
this is an offside offence if it impacts on the ability of the opponent to play or
challenge for the ball; if the player moves into the way of an opponent and
impedes the opponent’s progress (e.g. blocks the opponent), the offence
should be penalised under Law 12
• a player in an offside position is moving towards the ball with the intention of
playing the ball and is fouled before playing or attempting to play the ball,
or challenging an opponent for the ball, the foul is penalised as it has occurred
before the offside offence
• an offence is committed against a player in an offside position who is already
playing or attempting to play the ball, or challenging an opponent for the ball,
the offside offence is penalised as it has occurred before the foul challenge

100

3. No offence
There is no offside offence if a player receives the ball directly from:
• a goal kick
• a throw-in
• a corner kick

4. Offences and sanctions
If an offside offence occurs, the referee awards an indirect free kick where the
offence occurred, including if it is in the player’s own half of the field of play.

 defending player who leaves the field of play without the referee’s
A
permission shall be considered to be on the goal line or touchline for the
purposes of offside until the next stoppage in play or until the defending team
has played the ball towards the halfway line and it is outside its penalty area. If
the player left the field of play deliberately, the player must be cautioned when
the ball is next out of play.

 n attacking player may step or stay off the field of play not to be involved in
A
active play. If the player re-enters from the goal line and becomes involved in
play before the next stoppage in play or the defending team has played the
ball towards the halfway line and it is outside its penalty area, the player
shall be considered to be positioned on the goal line for the purposes of offside.
A player who deliberately leaves the field of play and re-enters without the
referee’s permission and is not penalised for offside and gains an advantage
must be cautioned.
I f an attacking player remains stationary between the goalposts and inside
the goal as the ball enters the goal, a goal must be awarded unless the player
commits an offside offence or a Law 12 offence, in which case play is restarted
with an indirect or direct free kick.

penalty area when not permitted to do so, an indirect free kick is awarded but
there is no disciplinary sanction.

2. Indirect free kick
An indirect free kick is awarded if a player:

• plays in a dangerous manner
• impedes the progress of an opponent without any contact being made
• i s guilty of dissent, using offensive, insulting or abusive language and/or
gestures or other verbal offences
• p
 revents the goalkeeper from releasing the ball from the hands or kicks
or attempts to kick the ball when the goalkeeper is in the process of
releasing it
• c ommits any other offence, not mentioned in the Laws, for which play is
stopped to caution or send off a player
 n indirect free kick is awarded if a goalkeeper, inside their penalty area,
A
commits any of the following offences:

• c ontrols the ball with the hand/arm for more than six seconds before releasing
it
• touches the ball with the hand/arm after releasing it and before it has touched
another player
• touches the ball with the hand/arm, unless the goalkeeper has clearly kicked
or attempted to kick the ball to release it into play, after:
••it has been deliberately kicked to the goalkeeper by a team-mate
••receiving it directly from a throw-in taken by a team-mate

A goalkeeper is considered to be in control of the ball with the hand(s) when:
• t he ball is between the hands or between the hand and any surface
(e.g. ground, own body) or by touching it with any part of the hands
or arms, except if the ball rebounds from the goalkeeper or the goalkeeper
has made a save
• holding the ball in the outstretched open hand
• bouncing it on the ground or throwing it in the air
A goalkeeper cannot be challenged by an opponent when in control of
the ball with the hand(s).

Playing in a dangerous manner
Playing in a dangerous manner is any action that, while trying to play the
ball, threatens injury to someone (including the player themself ) and includes
preventing a nearby opponent from playing the ball for fear of injury.
 scissors or bicycle kick is permissible provided that it is not dangerous to
A
an opponent.

Impeding the progress of an opponent without contact
Impeding the progress of an opponent means moving into the opponent’s path
to obstruct, block, slow down or force a change of direction when the ball is not
within playing distance of either player.
 ll players have a right to their position on the field of play; being in the way
A
of an opponent is not the same as moving into the way of an opponent.

 player may shield the ball by taking a position between an opponent and the
A
ball if the ball is within playing distance and the opponent is not held off with
the arms or body. If the ball is within playing distance, the player may be fairly
charged by an opponent.

3. Disciplinary action
The referee has the authority to take disciplinary action from entering the field
of play for the pre-match inspection until leaving the field of play after the
match ends (including kicks from the penalty mark).
106

I f, before entering the field of play at the start of the match, a player or team
official commits a sending-off offence, the referee has the authority to prevent
the player or team official taking part in the match (see Law 3.6); the referee
will report any other misconduct.

A player or team official who commits a cautionable or sending-off offence,
either on or off the field of play, is disciplined according to the offence.
 he yellow card communicates a caution and the red card communicates a
T
sending-off.

 nly a player, substitute, substituted player or team official may be shown the
O
red or yellow card.
Players, substitutes and substituted players
Delaying the restart of play to show a card
 nce the referee has decided to caution or send off a player, play must not be
O
restarted until the sanction has been administered, unless the non-offending
team takes a quick free kick, has a clear goal-scoring opportunity and the
referee has not started the disciplinary sanction procedure. The sanction is
administered at the next stoppage; if the offence was denying the opposing
team an obvious goal-scoring opportunity, the player is cautioned.

Advantage
If the referee plays the advantage for an offence for which a caution/
sending-off would have been issued had play been stopped, this caution/
sending-off must be issued when the ball is next out of play, except for the
denial of an obvious goal-scoring opportunity when the player is cautioned for
unsporting behaviour.
 dvantage should not be applied in situations involving serious foul play,
A
violent conduct or a second cautionable offence unless there is a clear
opportunity to score a goal. The referee must send off the player when the ball
is next out of play, but if the player plays the ball or challenges/interferes with

Laws of th e Game 2 019/20 | Law 12 | Fouls and Mis conduc t

107

an opponent, the referee will stop play, send off the player and restart with an
indirect free kick, unless the player committed a more serious offence.

I f a defender starts holding an attacker outside the penalty area and continues
holding inside the penalty area, the referee must award a penalty kick.
Cautionable offences
A player is cautioned if guilty of:

• delaying the restart of play
• dissent by word or action
• entering, re-entering or deliberately leaving the field of play without the
referee’s permission
• failing to respect the required distance when play is restarted with a corner
kick, free kick or throw-in
• persistent offences (no specific number or pattern of offences constitutes
'persistent')

• entering the referee review area (RRA)
• excessively using the ‘review’ (TV screen) signal
A substitute or substituted player is cautioned if guilty of:
•
•
•
•
•
•

delaying the restart of play
dissent by word or action
entering or re-entering the field of play without the referee’s permission
unsporting behaviour
entering the referee review area (RRA)
excessively using the ‘review’ (TV screen) signal

 here two separate cautionable offences are committed (even in close
W
proximity), they should result in two cautions, for example if a player enters
the field of play without the required permission and commits a reckless tackle
or stops a promising attack with a foul/handball, etc.

108

Cautions for unsporting behaviour
There are different circumstances when a player must be cautioned for
unsporting behaviour including if a player:

• a ttempts to deceive the referee, e.g. by feigning injury or pretending to have
been fouled (simulation)
• c hanges places with the goalkeeper during play or without the referee’s
permission (see Law 3)
• commits in a reckless manner a direct free kick offence
• handles the ball to interfere with or stop a promising attack
• c ommits a foul which interferes with or stops a promising attack, except
where the referee awards a penalty kick for an offence which was an attempt
to play the ball
• d
 enies an opponent an obvious goal-scoring opportunity by an offence which
was an attempt to play the ball and the referee awards a penalty kick
• h
 andles the ball in an attempt to score a goal (whether or not the attempt is
successful) or in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent a goal
• makes unauthorised marks on the field of play
• plays the ball when leaving the field of play after being given permission
to leave
• shows a lack of respect for the game
• uses a deliberate trick to pass the ball (including from a free kick) to the
goalkeeper with the head, chest, knee etc. to circumvent the Law, whether or
not the goalkeeper touches the ball with the hands
• verbally distracts an opponent during play or at a restart

Celebration of a goal
Players can celebrate when a goal is scored, but the celebration must not be
excessive; choreographed celebrations are not encouraged and must not cause
excessive time-wasting.
 eaving the field of play to celebrate a goal is not a cautionable offence but
L
players should return as soon as possible.

Laws of th e Game 2 019/20 | Law 12 | Fouls and Mis conduc t

109

A player must be cautioned, even if the goal is disallowed, for:

• c limbing onto a perimeter fence and/or approaching the spectators in
a manner which causes safety and/or security issues
• gesturing or acting in a provocative, derisory or inflammatory way
• covering the head or face with a mask or other similar item
• removing the shirt or covering the head with the shirt
Delaying the restart of play
Referees must caution players who delay the restart of play by:
•
•
•
•

appearing to take a throw-in but suddenly leaving it to a team-mate to take
delaying leaving the field of play when being substituted
excessively delaying a restart
kicking or carrying the ball away, or provoking a confrontation by
deliberately touching the ball after the referee has stopped play
• taking a free kick from the wrong position to force a retake
Sending-off offences
A player, substitute or substituted player who commits any of the following
offences is sent off:

• d
 enying the opposing team a goal or an obvious goal-scoring opportunity by
a handball offence (except a goalkeeper within their penalty area)
• denying a goal or an obvious goal-scoring opportunity to an opponent whose
overall movement is towards the offender’s goal by an offence punishable by
a free kick (unless as outlined below)
• serious foul play
• biting or spitting at someone
• violent conduct
• using offensive, insulting or abusive language and/or gestures
• receiving a second caution in the same match
• entering the video operation room (VOR)
 player, substitute or substituted player who has been sent off must leave the
A
vicinity of the field of play and the technical area.

110

Denying a goal or an obvious goal-scoring opportunity
 here a player denies the opposing team a goal or an obvious goal-scoring
W
opportunity by a handball offence, the player is sent off wherever the offence
occurs.

 here a player commits an offence against an opponent within their own
W
penalty area which denies an opponent an obvious goal-scoring opportunity
and the referee awards a penalty kick, the offender is cautioned if the offence
was an attempt to play the ball; in all other circumstances (e.g. holding, pulling,
pushing, no possibility to play the ball etc.) the offending player must be sent off.
 player, sent-off player, substitute or substituted player who enters the field of
A
play without the required referee’s permission and interferes with play or an
opponent and denies the opposing team a goal or an obvious goal-scoring
opportunity is guilty of a sending-off offence.
The following must be considered:
•
•
•
•

distance between the offence and the goal
general direction of the play
likelihood of keeping or gaining control of the ball
location and number of defenders

Serious foul play
A tackle or challenge that endangers the safety of an opponent or uses
excessive force or brutality must be sanctioned as serious foul play.

 ny player who lunges at an opponent in challenging for the ball from the
A
front, from the side or from behind using one or both legs, with excessive force
or endangers the safety of an opponent is guilty of serious foul play.
Violent conduct
Violent conduct is when a player uses or attempts to use excessive force or
brutality against an opponent when not challenging for the ball, or against a
team-mate, team official, match official, spectator or any other person,
regardless of whether contact is made.

Laws of th e Game 2 019/20 | Law 12 | Fouls and Mis conduc t

111

I n addition, a player who, when not challenging for the ball, deliberately
strikes an opponent or any other person on the head or face with the hand or
arm, is guilty of violent conduct unless the force used was negligible.
Team officials

 here an offence is committed and the offender cannot be identified, the
W
senior team coach present in the technical area will receive the sanction.

Warning
The following offences should usually result in a warning; repeated or blatant
offences should result in a caution or sending-off:

• entering the field of play in a respectful/non-confrontational manner
• failing to cooperate with a match official e.g. ignoring an instruction/request
from an assistant referee or the fourth official
• minor/low-level disagreement (by word or action) with a decision

Free Kicks
1. Types of free kick
Direct and indirect free kicks are awarded to the opposing team of a player,
substitute, substituted or sent-off player, or team official guilty of an offence.

Indirect free kick signal
The referee indicates an indirect free kick by raising the arm above the head;
this signal is maintained until the kick has been taken and the ball touches
another player, goes out of play or it is clear that a goal cannot be scored
directly.

 n indirect free kick must be retaken if the referee fails to signal that the kick is
A
indirect and the ball is kicked directly into the goal.
Ball enters the goal
• if a direct free kick is kicked directly into the opponents’ goal,
a goal is awarded
• if an indirect free kick is kicked directly into the opponents’ goal,
a goal kick is awarded
• if a direct or indirect free kick is kicked directly into the team’s
own goal, a corner kick is awarded

2. Procedure
All free kicks are taken from the place where the offence occurred, except:

• indirect free kicks to the attacking team for an offence inside the opponents’
goal area are taken from the nearest point on the goal area line which runs
parallel to the goal line
• free kicks to the defending team in their goal area may be taken from
anywhere in that area

117

• f ree kicks for offences involving a player entering, re-entering or leaving
the field of play without permission are taken from the position of the ball
when play was stopped. However, if a player commits an offence off the field
of play, play is restarted with a free kick taken on the boundary line nearest
to where the offence occurred; for direct free kick offences, a penalty kick is
awarded if this is within the offender’s penalty area
• where the Law designates another position (see Laws 3, 11, 12)
The ball:

• m

W
players must remain at least 1 m (1 yd) from the ‘wall’ until the ball is in play.
 free kick can be taken by lifting the ball with a foot or both feet
A
simultaneously.

an opponent in order to play the ball again but not in a careless or reckless
manner or using excessive force, the referee allows play to continue.

118

3. Offences and sanctions
If, when a free kick is taken, an opponent is closer to the ball than the required
distance, the kick is retaken unless the advantage can be applied; but if a player
takes a free kick quickly and an opponent who is less than 9.15 m (10 yds) from
the ball intercepts it, the referee allows play to continue. However, an opponent
who deliberately prevents a free kick being taken quickly must be cautioned
for delaying the restart of play.
I f, when a free kick is taken, an attacking team player is less than 1 m (1 yd)
from a ‘wall’ formed by three or more defending team players, an indirect free
kick is awarded.

I f, when a free kick is taken by the defending team inside its penalty area, any
opponents are inside the penalty area because they did not have time to leave,
the referee allows play to continue. If an opponent who is in the penalty area
when the free kick is taken, or enters the penalty area before the ball is in play,
touches or challenges for the ball before it is in play, the free kick is retaken.

I f, after the ball is in play, the kicker touches the ball again before it has
touched another player an indirect free kick is awarded, if the kicker commits a
handball offence:
• a direct free kick is awarded
• a penalty kick is awarded if the offence occurred inside the kicker’s penalty
area unless the kicker was the goalkeeper in which case an indirect free kick

For any other offence, the kick is retaken.

Law

The Corner Kick
 corner kick is awarded when the whole of the ball passes over the goal line,
A
on the ground or in the air, having last touched a player of the defending team,
and a goal is not scored.

 goal may be scored directly from a corner kick, but only against the opposing
A
team; if the ball directly enters the kicker’s goal a corner kick is awarded to the
opponents.

1. Procedure
• The ball must be placed in the corner area nearest to the point where the
ball passed over the goal line
• The ball must be stationary and is kicked by a player of the attacking team
• The ball is in play when it is kicked and clearly moves; it does not need to
leave the corner area
• The corner flagpost must not be moved
• Opponents must remain at least 9.15 m (10 yds) from the corner arc until
the ball is in play

2. Offences and sanctions
If, after the ball is in play, the kicker touches the ball again before it has
touched another player, an indirect free kick is awarded; if the kicker commits
a handball offence:

• a direct free kick is awarded
• a penalty kick is awarded if the offence occurred inside the kicker’s penalty
area, unless the kicker was the goalkeeper, in which case an indirect free kick
is awarded

I f a player, while correctly taking a corner kick, deliberately kicks the ball at an
opponent in order to play the ball again but not in a careless or reckless
manner or using excessive force, the referee allows play to continue.
For any other offence, the kick is retaken.

Video
Assistant
Referee
(VAR)
protocol

Protocol –
principles, practicalities
and procedures
 he VAR protocol, as far as possible, conforms to the principles and philosophy
T
of the Laws of the Game.
 he use of video assistant referees (VARs) is only permitted where the match/
T
competition organiser has fulfilled all the VAR protocol and implementation
requirements (as set out in the VAR Handbook) and has received written
permission from The IFAB and FIFA.

1. Principles
The use of VARs in football matches is based on a number of principles, all of
which must apply in every match using VARs.

1. A video assistant referee (VAR) is a match official, with independent
access to match footage, who may assist the referee only in the event of a
‘clear and obvious error’ or ‘serious missed incident’ in relation to:
a. Goal/no goal

b. Penalty/no penalty
c. Direct red card (not second yellow card/caution)

d. Mistaken identity (when the referee cautions or sends off the
wrong player of the offending team)

2. T
 he referee must always make a decision, i.e. the referee is not permitted to
give ‘no decision’ and then use the VAR to make the decision; a decision to
allow play to continue after an alleged offence can be reviewed.
3. The original decision given by the referee will not be changed unless
the video review clearly shows that the decision was a 'clear and
obvious error'.
Laws of th e Game 2 019/20 | VAR protocol

139

4. O
 nly the referee can initiate a ‘review’; the VAR (and other match officials)
can only recommend a ‘review’ to the referee.
5. The final decision is always taken by the referee, either based on
information from the VAR or after the referee has undertaken an ‘on-field
review’ (OFR).
6. There is no time limit for the review process as accuracy is more important
than speed.
7. The players and team officials must not surround the referee or attempt to
influence if a decision is reviewed, the review process or the final decision.
8. The referee must remain ‘visible’ during the review process to ensure
transparency.
9. If play continues after an incident which is then reviewed, any disciplinary
action taken/required during the post-incident period is not cancelled,
even if the original decision is changed (except a caution/sending-off for
stopping a promising attack or DOGSO).
10. If play has stopped and been restarted, the referee may not undertake a
‘review’ except for a case of mistaken identity or for a potential sending-off
offence relating to violent conduct, spitting, biting or extremely offensive,
insulting and/or abusive gesture(s).
11. The period of play before and after an incident that can be reviewed is
determined by the Laws of the Game and VAR protocol.
12. As the VAR will automatically ‘check’ every situation/decision, there is no
need for coaches or players to request a ‘review’.

2. Reviewable match-changing decisions/incidents
The referee may receive assistance from the VAR only in relation to four
categories of match-changing decisions/incidents. In all these situations, the
VAR is only used after the referee has made a (first/original) decision
(including allowing play to continue), or if a serious incident is missed/not
seen by the match officials.
 he referee`s original decision will not be changed unless there was a ‘clear
T
and obvious error’ (this includes any decision made by the referee based on
information from another match official e.g. offside).

140

 he categories of decision/incident which may be reviewed in the event of a
T
potential ‘clear and obvious error’ or ‘serious missed incident’ are:
a. Goal/no goal

• a ttacking team offence in the build-up to or scoring of the goal
(handball, foul, offside etc.)
• ball out of play prior to the goal
• goal/no goal decisions
• o
 ffence by goalkeeper and/or kicker at the taking of a penalty kick or
encroachment by an attacker or defender who becomes directly
involved in play if the penalty kick rebounds from the goalpost,
crossbar or goalkeeper

b. Penalty kick/no penalty kick

• a ttacking team offence in the build-up to the penalty incident
(handball, foul, offside etc.)
• ball out of play prior to the incident
• location of offence (inside or outside the penalty area)
• penalty kick incorrectly awarded
• penalty kick offence not penalised

c. Direct red cards (not second yellow card/caution)

•
•
•
•

DOGSO (especially position of offence and positions of other players)
serious foul play (or reckless challenge)
violent conduct, biting or spitting at another person
using offensive, insulting or abusive gestures

d. Mistaken identity (red or yellow card)

I f the referee penalises an offence and then gives the wrong player from
the offending (penalised) team a yellow or red card, the identity of the
offender can be reviewed; the actual offence itself cannot be reviewed
unless it relates to a goal, penalty incident or direct red card.

Laws of th e Game 2 019/20 | VAR protocol

141

3. Practicalities
Use of VARs during a match involves the following practical arrangements:

• T
 he VAR watches the match in the video operation room (VOR) assisted by
an assistant VAR (AVAR) and replay operator (RO)
• Depending on the number of camera angles (and other considerations) there
may be more than one AVAR or RO
• Only authorised persons are allowed to enter the VOR or communicate with
the VAR/AVAR/RO during the match
• The VAR has independent access to, and replay control of, TV broadcast
footage
• The VAR is connected to the communication system being used by the match
officials and can hear everything they say; the VAR can only speak to the
referee by pushing a button (to avoid the referee being distracted by
conversations in the VOR)
• If the VAR is busy with a ‘check’ or a ‘review’, the AVAR may speak to the
referee especially if the game needs to be stopped or to ensure play does
not restart
• If the referee decides to view the replay footage, the VAR will select the best
angle/replay speed; the referee can request other/additional angles/speeds

4. Procedures
Original decision
• T
 he referee and other match officials must always make an initial decision
(including any disciplinary action) as if there was no VAR (except for a
‘missed’ incident)
• The referee and other match officials are not permitted to give ‘no decision’
as this will lead to ‘weak/indecisive’ officiating, too many ‘reviews’ and
significant problems if there is a technology failure
• The referee is the only person who can make the final decision; the VAR has
the same status as the other match officials and can only assist the referee

142

• D
 elaying the flag/whistle for an offence is only permissible in a very clear
attacking situation when a player is about to score a goal or has a clear run
into/towards the opponents’ penalty area
• I f an assistant referee delays a flag for an offence, the assistant referee must
raise the flag if the attacking team scores a goal, is awarded a penalty kick,
free kick, corner kick or throw-in, or retains possession of the ball after the
initial attack has ended; in all other situations, the assistant referee should
decide whether or not to raise the flag, depending on the requirements of the
game

Check
• T
 he VAR automatically ‘checks’ the TV camera footage for every potential
or actual goal, penalty or direct red card decision/incident, or a case of
mistaken identity, using different camera angles and replay speeds
• The VAR can ‘check’ the footage in normal speed and/or in slow motion but,
in general, slow motion replays should only be used for facts, e.g. position of
offence/player, point of contact for physical offences and handball, ball out of
play (including goal/no goal); normal speed should be used for the ‘intensity’
of an offence or to decide if it was a handball offence
• If the ‘check’ does not indicate a ‘clear and obvious error’ or ‘serious missed
incident’, there is usually no need for the VAR to communicate with the
referee – this is a ‘silent check’; however, it sometimes helps the referee/
assistant referee to manage the players/match if the VAR confirms that no
‘clear and obvious error’ or ‘serious missed incident’ occurred
• If the restart of play needs to be delayed for a ‘check’, the referee will signal
this by clearly holding a finger to the earpiece/headset and extending the
other hand/arm; this signal must be maintained until the ‘check’ is complete
as it announces that the referee is receiving information (which may be from
the VAR or another match official)
• If the ‘check’ indicates a probable ‘clear and obvious error’ or ‘serious missed
incident’, the VAR will communicate this information (but not the decision to
be taken) to the referee who will then decide whether or not to initiate a
‘review’

Laws of th e Game 2 019/20 | VAR protocol

143

Review
• The referee can initiate a ‘review’ for a potential ‘clear and obvious error’ or
‘serious missed incident’ when:
••the VAR (or another match official) recommends a ‘review’
••the referee suspects that something serious has been ‘missed’

• If play has already stopped, the referee delays the restart 
• If play has not already stopped, the referee stops play when the ball is next in
a neutral zone/situation (usually when neither team is in an attacking move)
• In both situations, the referee must indicate that a ‘review’ will take place by
clearly showing the ‘TV signal’ (outline of a TV screen)
• The VAR describes to the referee what can be seen on the TV replay(s) but
not the decision to be taken, and the referee then:

••makes a final decision based on the referee’s own perception and the
information from the VAR, and, where appropriate, input from other match
officials – VAR-only review
or
••goes to the referee review area to view replay footage – ‘on-field review’
(OFR) – before making a final decision. The other match officials will not
review the footage unless, in exceptional circumstances, asked to do so by
the referee

• A
 t the end of both review processes, the referee must show the ‘TV signal’
again, immediately followed by the final decision
• For factual decisions e.g. position of an offence or player (offside), point of
contact (handball/foul), location (inside or outside the penalty area), ball out
of play etc. a VAR-only review is usually appropriate but an ‘on-field review’
(OFR) can be used for a factual decision if it will help manage the players/
match or ‘sell’ the decision (e.g. a crucial match-deciding decision late in the
game)
• For subjective decisions, e.g. intensity of a foul challenge, interference at
offside, handball considerations, an ‘on-field review’ (OFR) is often
appropriate

144

• T
 he referee can request different cameras angles/replay speeds but, in
general, slow motion replays should only be used for facts e.g. position of
offence/player, point of contact for physical offences and handball, ball out of
play (including goal/no goal); normal speed should be used for the ‘intensity’
of an offence or to decide if it was a handball offence
• F
 or decisions/incidents relating to goals, penalty/no penalty and red cards
for denying an obvious goal-scoring opportunity (DOGSO), it may be
necessary to review the attacking phase of play which led directly to the
decision/incident; this may include how the attacking team gained
possession of the ball in open play
• T
 he Laws of the Game do not allow restart decisions (corner kicks, throw-ins
etc.) to be changed once play has restarted, so they cannot be reviewed
• I f play has stopped and restarted, the referee may only undertake a ‘review’,
and take the appropriate disciplinary sanction, for a case of mistaken
identity or for a potential sending-off offence relating to violent conduct,
spitting, biting or extremely offensive, insulting and/or abusive gesture(s)
• T
 he review process should be completed as efficiently as possible, but the
accuracy of the final decision is more important than speed. For this reason,
and because some situations are complex with several reviewable decisions/
incidents, there is no maximum time limit for the review process
Final decision
• W
 hen the review process is completed, the referee must show the ‘TV signal’
and communicate the final decision
• T
 he referee will then take/change/rescind any disciplinary action (where
appropriate) and restart play in accordance with the Laws of the Game
Players, substitutes and team officials
• A
 s the VAR will automatically ‘check’ every situation/incident, there is no
need for coaches or players to request a ‘check’ or ‘review’
• P
 layers, substitutes and team officials must not attempt to influence
or interfere with the review process, including when the final decision is
communicated

Laws of th e Game 2 019/20 | VAR protocol

• D
 uring the review process, players should remain on the field of play;
substitutes and team officials should remain off the field of play
• A player/substitute/substituted player/team official who excessively shows
the TV signal or enters the RRA will be cautioned
• A player/substitute/substituted player/team official who enters the VOR will
be sent off
Match validity
In principle, a match is not invalidated because of:

Details of
all Law changes

(in Law order)

The following lists all changes to the Laws of the Game since edition 2018/19.
For each change the old wording (where appropriate) and the new/changed/
additional wording are given followed by an explanation for the change.
Law 01 – The Field of Play
14. Video assistant referees (VARs)
Amended text
Video operation room (VOR)
A player, substitute, or substituted player or team official who enters the VOR
will be sent off. a team official who enters the VOR will be dismissed from the
technical area.
Referee review area (RRA)
A player, substitute, or substituted player or team official who enters the RRA
will be cautioned. a team official who enters the RRA will be publicly given an
official warning (or cautioned where YCs are used for team officials).
Explanation
Misconduct by team officials is now a sanction using YC/RC.

154

Law 03 – The Players
3. Substitution procedure
Amended text
To replace a player with a substitute, the following must be observed:
•• (…)
•• the player being substituted:
·· receives the referee’s permission to leave the field of play, unless already off
the field, and must leave by the nearest point on the boundary line unless
the referee indicates that the player may leave directly and immediately at
the halfway line or another point (e.g. for safety/security or injury)
·· the player being replaced is not obliged to leave at the halfway line and
must go immediately to the technical area or dressing room and takes no
further part in the match, except where return substitutions are permitted
•• if a player who is to be replaced substituted refuses to leave, play continues

Explanation
To stop a player who is being substituted ‘wasting’ time by leaving slowly at the
halfway line (which is not a Law requirement) the player must leave at the
nearest point (as with an injury) unless the referee indicates otherwise, e.g. if
the player can leave quickly at the halfway line, there is a safety/security issue
or the player leaves on a stretcher. The player must go immediately to the
technical area or dressing room to avoid problems with substitutes, spectators,
or the match officials. A player who infringes the spirit of this Law should be
sanctioned for unsporting behaviour i.e. delaying the restart of play.

Law 04 – The Players' Equipment
3. Colours
Additional text
Undershirts must be:
•• a single colour which is the same as the main colour of the shirt sleeve or
•• a pattern/colours which exactly replicate(s) the shirt sleeve
Explanation
Manufacturers now make patterned undershirts whose sleeves are the same as
the main shirt sleeve; these should be allowed as they help match officials’
decision-making.
Law 05 – The Referee
2. Decisions of the referee
Amended text
The referee may not change a restart decision on realising it is incorrect or on
the advice of another match official if play has restarted or the referee has
signalled the end of the first or second half (including extra time) and left the
field of play or terminated abandoned the match. However, if at the end of the
half, the referee leaves the field of play to go to the referee review area (RRA)
or to instruct the players to return to the field of play, this does not prevent a
decision being changed for an incident which occurred before the end of the
half.
Except as outlined in Law 12.3 and the VAR protocol, a disciplinary sanction may
only be issued after play has restarted if another match official had identified
and attempted to communicate the offence to the referee before play restarted;
the restart associated with the sanction does not apply.

156

Explanation
•• The word ‘terminated’ is not easily translated – ‘abandoned’ is better
•• If, at the end of a half, the referee goes to the RRA or to tell the players to
return to the field, a ‘review’ is allowed and a decision can be changed for an
offence which occurred before the half ended
•• Sometimes a match official indicates/communicates a YC/RC offence (e.g. AR
flagging for violent conduct off the ball) but the referee does not see the
indication/hear the communication until after play has restarted. The referee
can take the appropriate disciplinary action, but the restart associated with
the offence does not apply

3. Powers and duties – Disciplinary action
Amended text
(…)
•• takes action against team officials who fail to act in a responsible manner and
may expel them warns or shows a yellow card for a caution or a red card for
a sending-off from the field of play and its immediate surrounds, including
the technical area; if the offender cannot be identified, the senior coach
present in the technical area will receive the sanction. A medical team official
who commits a dismissible sending-off offence may remain if (…)
Explanation
The experiment with YC/RC for misconduct by team officials has been
successful and has revealed many benefits at all levels, including for young
referees dealing with ‘difficult’ adult coaches. If the offender cannot be
identified, the senior team official (usually the main coach) in the technical area
will receive the YC/RC (as the person responsible for the other team officials).

157

3. Powers and duties – Injuries
Additional text
(…)
•• An injured player may not be treated on the field of play (…). Exceptions to the
requirement to leave the field of play are only when:
•• (…)
•• a penalty kick has been awarded and the injured player will be the kicker
Explanation
It is unfair if the team’s kicker needs assessment/treatment and then has to
leave the field and cannot take the penalty kick.

Law 07 – The Duration of the Match
3. Allowance for time lost
Amended text
Allowance is made by the referee in each half for all time lost in that half
through:
(…)
•• stoppages for drinks (which should not exceed one minute) or other medical
reasons permitted by competition rules
•• medical stoppages permitted by competition rules e.g. ’drinks’ breaks (which
should not exceed one minute) and ‘cooling’ breaks (ninety seconds to three
minutes)
Explanation
In the interests of player safety, competition rules may allow, in certain weather
conditions (e.g. high humidity and temperatures), ‘cooling’ breaks (from ninety
seconds to three minutes) to allow the body’s temperature to fall; they are
different from ‘drinks’ breaks (maximum one minute) which are for rehydration.

158

Law 08 – The Start and Restart of Play
1. Kick-off – Procedure
Amended text
•• the team that wins the toss of a coin decides which goal it will to attack in the
first half or to take the kick-off
•• depending on the above, their opponents take the kick-off or decide which
goal to attack in the first half
•• the team that wins the toss decided which goal to attack in the first half takes
the kick-off to start the second half
Explanation
Recent Law changes have made the kick-off more dynamic (e.g. a goal can be
scored directly from the kick-off) so captains winning the toss often ask to take
the kick-off.

ground.
Any number of players may contest a
dropped ball (including the
goalkeepers); the referee cannot
decide who may contest a dropped
ball or its outcome.

160

Explanation
The current dropped ball procedure often leads to a ‘manufactured’ restart
which is ‘exploited’ unfairly (e.g. kicking the ball out for a throw-in deep in the
opponents’ half) or an aggressive confrontation. Returning the ball to the team
that last played it (had possession) restores what was ‘lost’ when play was
stopped, except in the penalty area where it is simpler to return the ball to the
goalkeeper. To prevent that team gaining an unfair advantage, all players of
both teams, except the player receiving the ball, must be at least 4 m (4.5 yds)
away.
Law 09 – The Ball In and Out of Play
1. Ball out of play
Additional text
The ball is out of play when:
•• (…)
•• it touches a match official, remains on the field of play and:
·· a team starts a promising attack or
·· the ball goes directly into the goal or
·· the team in possession of the ball changes
In all these cases, play is restarted with a dropped ball.
Explanation
It can be very unfair if a team gains an advantage or scores a goal because the
ball has hit a match official, especially the referee.
2. Ball in play
Amended text
The ball is in play at all other times including when it touches a match official
and when it rebounds off a match official, goalpost, crossbar or corner flagpost
and remains on the field of play.

Except as outlined in Law 9.1, the ball is in play when it touches a match official.
Law 10 – Determining the Outcome of a Match
1. Goal scored
Additional text
(…)
If the goalkeeper throws the ball directly into the opponents’ goal, a goal kick is
awarded.
Explanation
Change to be consistent with re-wording of handball in Law 12.
Law 12 – Fouls and Misconduct
1. Direct free kick – Handling the ball
Amended text
The main part of the ‘Handling the ball’ section on handball has been re-written
(see p. 104-105)

162

Explanation
Greater clarity is needed for handball, especially on those occasions when
‘non-deliberate’ handball is an offence. The re-wording follows a number of
principles:
•• football does not accept a goal being scored by a hand/arm (even if
accidental)
•• football expects a player to be penalised for handball if they gain possession/
control of the ball from their hand/arm and gain a major advantage e.g. score
or create a goal-scoring opportunity
•• it is natural for a player to put their arm between their body and the ground
for support when falling
•• having the hand/arm above shoulder height is rarely a ‘natural’ position and a
player is ‘taking a risk’ by having the hand/arm in that position, including
when sliding
•• if the ball comes off the player’s body, or off another player (of either team)
who is close by, onto the hand/arm it is often impossible to avoid contact
with the ball
1. Direct free kick – Handling the ball
Amended text
The goalkeeper has the same restrictions on handling the ball as any other
player outside the penalty area. Inside their penalty area, the goalkeeper cannot
be guilty of a handling offence incurring a direct free kick; or any related
sanction but can be guilty of handling offences that incur an indirect free kick. If
the goalkeeper handles the ball inside their penalty area when not permitted to
do so, an indirect free kick is awarded but there is no disciplinary sanction.

Laws of th e Game 2 019/20 | Details of all Law c hanges

163

Explanation
Goalkeepers cannot handle the ball in their penalty area from a deliberate kick
or throw-in from a team-mate, or having released the ball from their hands. If
they do, it is an IDFK but this and any other ‘illegal’ handling does not incur any
disciplinary sanction even if it stops a promising attack or denies a goal or an
obvious goal-scoring opportunity.

2. Indirect free kick
Amended text
An indirect free kick is awarded if a goalkeeper, inside their penalty area,
commits any of the following offences:
•• controls the ball with the hands/arm for more than six seconds before
releasing it
•• touches the ball with the hands/arm after releasing it and before it has
touched another player
•• touches the ball with the hand/arm, unless the goalkeeper has clearly kicked
or attempted to kick the ball to release it into play, after:
·· it has been deliberately kicked to the goalkeeper by a team-mate
·· receiving it directly from a throw-in taken by a team-mate
Explanation

•• Inclusion of ‘arm’ is consistent with other parts of the Law relating to
handling the ball
•• When the GK clearly kicks or tries to kick the ball into play, this shows no
intention to handle the ball so, if the ‘clearance’ attempt is unsuccessful, the
goalkeeper can then handle the ball without committing an offence

164

3. Disciplinary action
Amended text
If, before entering the field of play at the start of the match, a player or team
official commits a sending-off offence, the referee has the authority to prevent
the player or team official taking part in the match (see Law 3.6); the referee
will report any other misconduct.
A player or team official who commits a cautionable or sending-off offence,
either on or off the field of play, against an opponent, a team-mate, a match
official or any other person or the Laws of the Game, is disciplined according to
the offence.
(…)
Only a player, substitute, or substituted player or team official may be shown
the red or yellow card.
Explanation
Red and yellow cards may now be shown to team officials (see Law 5).
3. Disciplinary action – Delaying the restart to show a card
Additional text
Once the referee has decided to caution or send off a player, play must not be
restarted until the sanction has been administered, unless the non-offending
team takes a quick free kick, has a clear goal-scoring opportunity and the
referee has not started the disciplinary sanction procedure. The sanction is
administered at the next stoppage; if the offence was denying the opposing
team an obvious goal-scoring opportunity, the player is cautioned.

Laws of th e Game 2 019/20 | Details of all Law c hanges

165

Explanation
Occasionally, an attack is stopped by a cautionable or sending-off offence and
the attacking team takes a quick free kick which restores the ‘lost’ attack; it is
clearly ‘unfair’ if this ‘new’ attack is stopped to issue the YC/RC. However, if the
referee has distracted the offending team by starting the YC/RC procedure, the
quick free kick is not allowed. For a DOGSO offence, the player will be cautioned
and not sent off because the attack was re-started (as when advantage is
applied for a DOGSO offence).
3. Disciplinary action – Celebration of a goal
Additional text
A player must be cautioned, even if the goal is disallowed, for:
(…)
Explanation
Cautions for inappropriate goal celebrations apply even if the goal is disallowed
as the impact (safety, image of the game etc.) is the same as if the goal was
awarded.
3. Disciplinary action – Team officials
Additional text
A new section - ‘Team officials’ - has been added outlining the usual offences
for which a team official may be warned, cautioned or sent-off (see p. 112).
Explanation
The correct use of the YC/RC for misconduct by team officials will be assisted
by including the main warning/YC/RC offences in the Laws.

166

4. Restart of play after fouls and misconduct
Amended text
If the ball is in play and a player commits an a physical offence inside the field
of play against:
•• an opponent – indirect or direct free kick or penalty kick
•• a team-mate, substitute, substituted or sent-off player, team official, match
official – a direct free kick or penalty kick
•• any other person – a dropped ball
All verbal offences are penalised with an indirect free kick.
Explanation
Confirmation of the different restarts for physical offences and that all verbal
offences, even if directed at a match official, are penalised with an indirect free
kick.
4. Restart of play after fouls and misconduct
Additional text
If an offence is committed outside the field of play by a player against a player,
substitute, substituted player or team official of their own team, play is
restarted with an indirect free kick on the boundary line closest to where the
offence occurred.
Explanation
Clarification that the offence must be committed by a player against a
team-mate or one of his/her team officials, substitutes etc. for an IDFK to be
awarded.

Laws of th e Game 2 019/20 | Details of all Law c hanges

167

4. Restart of play after fouls and misconduct
Amended text
If a player standing who is on or off the field of play throws or kicks an object
(other than the match ball) at an opposing player, or throws or kicks an object
(including a ball) at an opposing player, substitute, substituted or sent-off
player, or team official, or a match official or the match ball, play is restarted
with a direct free kick (…)
Explanation
Kicking an object at someone or the ball is punished the same as throwing an
object.
Law 13 – Free kicks
1. Types of free kick – Indirect free kick signal
Additional text
The referee indicates an indirect free kick by raising the arm above the head;
this signal is maintained until the kick has been taken and the ball touches
another player, or goes out of play or it is clear that a goal cannot be scored
directly.
Explanation
Many indirect free kicks are too far from the opponents’ goal for a goal to be
scored directly (e.g. IDFKs for offside); in these cases, the referee only needs to
maintain the signal until the kick is taken because running when showing the
signal is not easy.

168

2. Procedure
Amended text
•• free kicks for offences involving a player entering, re-entering or leaving the
field of play without permission are taken from the position of the ball when
play was stopped. However, if a player leaves the field of play as part of play
and commits an offence off the field of play against another player, play is
restarted with a free kick taken on the boundary line nearest to where the
offence occurred; (…)
Explanation
Text amended to be consistent with other parts of the Laws.
2. Procedure
Amended text
The ball:
•• (…)
•• is in play when it is kicked and clearly moves except for a free kick to the
defending team in their penalty area where the ball is in play when it is kicked
directly out of the penalty area
Explanation
The experiment where, at a defending team free kick in the penalty area, the
ball is in play once it is kicked, and does not have to leave the penalty area, has
produced a faster and more constructive restart. Opponents must remain
outside the penalty area and at least 9.15 m away until the ball is in play. The
same change has been made to the goal kick (see Law 16).

Laws of th e Game 2 019/20 | Details of all Law c hanges

169

2. Procedure
Additional text
Until the ball is in play, all opponents must remain:
•• at least 9.15 m (10 yds) from the ball, unless (…)
•• outside the penalty area for free kicks inside the opponents’ penalty area
Where three or more defending team players form a ‘wall’, all attacking team
players must remain at least 1 m (1 yd) from the ‘wall’ until the ball is in play.
Explanation
Attackers standing very close to, or in, the defensive ‘wall’ at a free kick often
cause management problems and waste time. There is no legitimate tactical
justification for attackers to be in the ‘wall’ and their presence is against the
‘spirit of the game’ and often damages the image of the game.

3. Offences and sanctions
Additional text
If, when a free kick is taken, an attacking team player is less than 1 m (1 yd) from
a ‘wall’ formed by three or more defending team players, an indirect free kick is
awarded.
Explanation
Confirmation of the restart if an attacking player encroaches within 1 m of the
‘wall’.

170

3. Offences and sanctions
Amended text
If, when a free kick is taken by the defending team from inside its penalty area,
any opponents are inside the penalty area (…), touches or challenges for the ball
before it has touched another player is in play, the free kick is retaken.
If, when a free kick is taken by the defending team inside its penalty area, the
ball is not kicked directly out of the penalty area the kick is retaken
Explanation
Confirmation of the restart for the above situation.
Law 14 – The Penalty Kick
1. Procedure
Additional text
The ball must be stationary on the penalty mark and the goalposts, crossbar
and goal net must not be moving.
(…)
The defending goalkeeper must remain on the goal line, facing the kicker,
between the goalposts, without touching the goalposts, crossbar or goal net,
until the ball has been kicked.
(…)
The player taking the penalty kick must kick the ball forward; backheeling is
permitted provided the ball moves forward.
When the ball is kicked, the defending goalkeeper must have at least part of one
foot touching, or in line with, the goal line.

Laws of th e Game 2 019/20 | Details of all Law c hanges

171

Explanation
The referee must not signal for the penalty kick to be taken if the goalkeeper is
touching the goalposts, crossbar or net, or if they are moving e.g. the goalkeeper
has kicked/shaken them.
Goalkeepers are not permitted to stand in front of or behind the line. Allowing
the goalkeeper to have only one foot touching the goal line (or, if jumping, in line
with the goal line) when the penalty kick is taken is a more practical approach
as it is easier to identify than if both feet are not on the line. As the kicker can
‘stutter’ in the run, it is reasonable that the goalkeeper can take one step in
anticipation of the kick.
2. Offences and sanctions
Additional text
Once the referee has signalled for a penalty kick to be taken, the kick must be
taken; if it is not taken the referee may take disciplinary action before signalling
again for the kick to be taken.
If, before (…).
Explanation
If an offence occurs after the referee has signalled for a penalty kick to be taken
but the kick is not taken, a free kick cannot be awarded as the ball has not been
put into play; the necessary disciplinary action can be taken.

172

Law 15 – The Throw-in
1. Procedure
Amended text
All opponents must stand at least 2 m (2 yds) from the point at which on the
touchline where the throw-in is to be taken.
Explanation
This covers situations where a player takes a throw-in some distance from the
touchline.

Law 16 – The Goal Kick
Amended text
A goal may be scored directly from a goal kick, but only against the opposing
team; if the ball directly enters the kicker’s goal, a corner kick is awarded to the
opponents if the ball left the penalty area.
Explanation
The ball is now in play once it has been kicked and clearly moves.

173

1. Procedure
Amended text
The ball is in play when it leaves the penalty area is kicked and clearly moves
Explanation
The experiment that at a goal kick the ball is in play once it is kicked, and does
not have to leave the penalty area, has created a faster and more dynamic/
constructive restart to the game. It has reduced the time ‘lost/wasted’ including
stopping the tactic of ‘wasting’ time when a defender deliberately plays the ball
before it leaves the penalty area knowing that all that will happen is the goal
kick will be retaken. Opponents must remain outside the penalty area until the
ball is in play.
2. Offences and sanctions
Amended text
If, when a goal kick is taken, any opponents are inside the penalty area because
they did not have time to leave, the referee allows play to continue. If an
opponent who is in the penalty area (…), touches or challenges for the ball
before it has touched another player is in play, the goal kick is retaken.
Explanation
Confirmation of the action the referee should take when an opponent is inside
the penalty area when a goal kick is taken.

174

VAR Protocol
2. Reviewable match-changing decisions/incidents
Amended text
The categories of decision/incident which may be reviewed in the event of a
potential ‘clear and obvious error’ or ‘serious missed incident’ are:
a. Goal/no goal
An offence by the team that scored the goal in the attacking phase that ended
with the scoring of a goal, including:
•• attacking team offence in the build-up to or scoring of the goal (handball, foul,
offside etc.)
•• offside: position and offence
•• ball out of play prior to the goal
•• goal/no goal decisions
•• offence by goalkeeper and/or kicker at the taking of a penalty kick or
encroachment by an attacker or defender who becomes directly involved in
play if the penalty kick rebounds from the goalpost, crossbar or goalkeeper
b. Penalty kick/no penalty kick
•• attacking team offence in the build-up to the penalty incident (handball, foul,
offside etc.)
•• ball out of play prior to the incident
•• location of offence (inside or outside the penalty area)
•• penalty kick incorrectly awarded
•• penalty kick offence not penalised
•• offence by goalkeeper and/or kicker at the taking of a penalty kick
•• encroachment by an attacker or defender who becomes directly involved in
play if the penalty kick rebounds from the goalpost, crossbar or goalkeeper
Explanation
Text simplified and bullet points moved as offences at the taking of a penalty
kick are ‘goal/no goal’ incidents.

175

4. Procedures – Original decision
Additional text
If an assistant referee delays a flag for an offence, the assistant referee must
raise the flag if the attacking team scores a goal, is awarded a penalty kick, free
kick, corner kick or throw-in, or retains possession of the ball after the initial
attack has ended; in all other situations, the assistant referee should decide
whether or not to raise the flag, depending on the requirements of the game
Explanation
Clarification of when the assistant referee must raise a ‘delayed’ flag for a very
close decision.
4. Procedures – Players, substitutes and team officials
Amended text
•• A player/substitute/substituted player/team official who excessively shows
the TV signal or enters the RRA will be cautioned
•• A team official who excessively shows the TV signal or enters the RRA will be
publically officially warned (or cautioned where yellow and red cards for
team officials are in use)
•• A player/substitute/substituted player/team official who enters the VOR will
be sent off; a team official who enters the VOR will be dismissed from the
technical area
Explanation
Reference to RC/YC for team officials required following change to Law 5 and
12.

Practical
Guidelines
for Match
Officials

Introduction
 hese guidelines contain practical advice for match officials which
T
supplements the information in the Laws of the Game section.

 eference is made in Law 5 to referees operating within the framework of the
R
Laws of the Game and the ‘spirit of the game’. Referees are expected to use
common sense and to apply the ‘spirit of the game’ when applying the Laws of
the Game, especially when making decisions relating to whether a match takes
place and/or continues.
 his is especially true for the lower levels of football where it may not always
T
be possible for the Law to be strictly applied. For example, unless there are
safety issues, the referee should allow a game to start/continue if:

• one or more corner flags is missing
• t here is a minor inaccuracy with the markings on the field of play such as
the corner area, centre circle etc.
• the goal posts/crossbar are not white

I n such cases, the referee should, with the agreement of the teams, play/
continue the match and must submit a report to the appropriate authorities.
Key:

• AR = assistant referee
• AAR = additional assistant referee

Positioning, Movement
and Teamwork
1. General positioning and movement
The best position is one from which the referee can make the correct decision.
All recommendations about positioning must be adjusted using specific
information about the teams, the players and events in the match.

 he positions recommended in the graphics are basic guidelines. The reference
T
to a “zone” emphasises that a recommended position is an area within which
the referee is likely to be most effective. The zone may be larger, smaller or
differently shaped depending on the exact match circumstances.
Recommendations:
• The play should be between the referee and the lead AR
• The lead AR should be in the referee’s field of vision so the referee should
usually use a wide diagonal system
• Staying towards the outside of the play makes it easier to keep play and the
lead AR in the referee’s field of vision
• The referee should be close enough to see play without interfering with play
• “What needs to be seen” is not always in the vicinity of the ball. The referee
should also pay attention to:
••player confrontations off the ball
••possible offences in the area towards which play is moving
••offences occurring after the ball is played away

Positioning of assistant referees and additional assistant referees
The AR must be in line with the second-last defender or the ball if it is nearer
to the goal line than the second-last defender. The AR must always face the
field of play, even when running. Side-to-side movement should be used for
short distances. This is especially important when judging offside as it gives
the AR a better line of vision.

 he AAR position is behind the goal line except where it is necessary to move
T
onto the goal line to judge a goal/no goal situation. The AAR is not allowed to
enter the field of play unless there are exceptional circumstances.

2.	Positioning and teamwork
Consultation
When dealing with disciplinary issues, eye contact and a basic discreet hand
signal from the AR to the referee may be sufficient. When direct consultation
is required, the AR may advance 2–3 metres onto the field of play if necessary.
When talking, the referee and AR should both face the field of play to avoid
being heard by others and to observe the players and field of play.
Corner kick
The AR’s position for a corner kick is behind the corner flag in line with the
goal line but the AR must not interfere with the player taking the corner kick
and must check that the ball is properly placed in the corner area.

Free kick
The AR’s position for a free kick must be in line with the second-last defender
to check the offside line. However, the AR must be ready to follow the ball
by moving down the touchline towards the corner flag if there is a direct shot
on goal.

Goal/no goal
When a goal has been scored and there is no doubt about the decision, the
referee and assistant referee must make eye contact and the assistant referee
must then move quickly 25–30 metres along the touchline towards the halfway
line without raising the flag.
 hen a goal has been scored but the ball appears still to be in play, the
W
assistant referee must first raise the flag to attract the referee’s attention then
continue with the normal goal procedure of running quickly 25–30 metres
along the touchline towards the halfway line.

 n occasions when the whole of the ball does not cross the goal line and
O
play continues as normal because a goal has not been scored, the referee must
make eye contact with the assistant referee and if necessary give a discreet
hand signal.

Goal kick
T he AR must first check if the ball is inside the goal area. If the ball is not
placed correctly, the AR must not move from the position, make eye contact
with the referee and raise the flag. Once the ball is placed correctly inside
the goal area, the AR must take a position to check the offside line.

 owever, if there is an AAR, the AR should take up a position in line with the
H
offside line and the AAR must be positioned at the intersection of the goal
line and the goal area, and check if the ball is placed inside the goal area.
If the ball is not placed correctly, the AAR must communicate this to the
referee.

Kicks from the penalty mark
One AR must be positioned at the intersection of the goal line and the goal area.
The other AR must be situated in the centre circle to control the players. If there
are AARs, they must be positioned at each intersection of the goal line and the
goal area, to the right and left of the goal respectively, except where GLT is in use
when only one AAR is required. AAR2 and AR1 should monitor the players in the

Mass confrontation
In situations of mass confrontation, the nearest AR may enter the field of play
to assist the referee. The other AR must observe and record details of the
incident. The fourth official should remain in the vicinity of the technical areas.
Required distance
When a free kick is awarded very close to the AR, the AR may enter the field
of play (usually at the request of the referee) to help ensure that the players
are positioned 9.15 m (10 yds) from the ball. In this case, the referee must wait
until the AR is back in position before restarting play.
Substitution
If there is no fourth official, the AR moves to the halfway line to assist with the
substitution procedure; the referee must wait until the AR is back in position
before restarting play.
I f there is a fourth official, the AR does not need to move to the halfway line
as the fourth official carries out the substitution procedure unless there are
several substitutions at the same time in which case the AR moves to the
halfway line to assist the fourth official.

Body Language,
Communication
and Whistle
1. Referees
Body language
Body language is a tool that the referee uses to:
• help control the match
• show authority and self-control

Body language is not an explanation of a decision.
Signals
See Law 5 for diagrams of signals
Whistle
The whistle is needed to:

• start play (first and second half of normal play and extra time), after a goal
• stop play:
••for a free kick or penalty kick
••if the match is suspended or abandoned
••at the end of each half
• restart play for:
••free kicks when the appropriate distance is required
••penalty kicks
• restart play after it has been stopped for a:
••caution or sending-off
••injury
••substitution

208

The whistle is NOT needed to:

• stop play for a clear:
••goal kick, corner kick, throw-in or goal

• restart play from:
••most free kicks, and a goal kick, corner kick, throw-in or dropped ball

 whistle which is used too frequently/unnecessarily will have less impact
A
when it is needed.

I f the referee wants the player(s) to wait for the whistle before restarting play
(e.g. when ensuring that defending players are 9.15m at a free kick) the referee
must clearly inform the attacking player(s) to wait for the whistle.
I f the referee blows the whistle in error and play stops, play is restarted with a
dropped ball.

2. Assistant referees
Beep signal
The beep signal system is an additional signal which is only used to gain the
referee’s attention. Situations when the signal beep may be useful include:
• offside
• offences (outside the view of the referee)
• throw in, corner kick, goal kick or goal (tight decisions)

Electronic communication system
Where an electronic communication system is used, the referee will advise the
ARs as to when it may be appropriate to use the communication system with,
or instead of, a physical signal.

Flag technique
The AR’s flag must always be unfurled and visible to the referee. This usually
means the flag is carried in the hand closest to the referee. When making a
signal, the AR stops running, faces the field of play, makes eye contact with the
referee and raises the flag with a deliberate (not hasty or exaggerated) motion.
The flag should be like an extension of the arm. The ARs must raise the flag
using the hand that will be used for the next signal. If circumstances change
Laws of th e Game 2 019/20 | Prac tic al Guidelines for Matc h Offi c i a l s

209

and the other hand must be used, the AR should move the flag to the opposite
hand below the waist. If the AR signals that the ball is out of play, the signal
must be maintained until the referee acknowledges it.
I f the AR signals for a sending-off offence and the signal is not seen
immediately:

• i f play has been stopped, the restart may be changed in accordance with the
Laws (free kick, penalty kick, etc.)
• if play has restarted, the referee may still take disciplinary action but not
penalise the offence with a free kick or penalty kick
Gestures
As a general rule, the AR should not use obvious hand signals. However, in
some instances, a discreet hand signal may assist the referee. The hand signal
should have a clear meaning which should have been agreed in the pre-match
discussion.
Signals
See Law 6 for diagrams of signals

Corner kick/goal kick
When the ball wholly passes over the goal line the AR raises the flag with the
right hand (better line of vision) to inform the referee that the ball is out of
play and then if it is:
• n
 ear to the AR – indicate whether it is a goal kick or a corner kick
• far from the AR – make eye contact and follow the referee’s decision

 hen the ball clearly passes over the goal line the AR does not need to raise
W
the flag to indicate that the ball has left the field of play. If the goal kick or
corner kick decision is obvious, it is not necessary to give a signal, especially
when the referee gives a signal.
Fouls
The AR must raise the flag when a foul or misconduct is committed in the
immediate vicinity or out of the referee’s vision. In all other situations,
the AR must wait and offer an opinion if it is required and then inform the
referee what was seen and heard, and which players were involved.
210

Before signalling for an offence, the AR must determine that:

• t he offence was out of the referee’s view or the referee’s view was obstructed
• t he referee would not have applied the advantage
 hen an offence occurs which requires a signal from the AR,
W
the AR must:

• r aise the flag with the same hand that will also be used for the remainder of
the signal – this gives the referee a clear indication as to who will be awarded
the free kick
• make eye contact with the referee
• g ive the flag a slight wave back and forth (avoiding any excessive or
aggressive movement)
 he AR must use the “wait and see technique” to allow play to continue and not
T
raise the flag when the team against which an offence has been committed will
benefit from the advantage; it is therefore very important for the AR to make
eye contact with the referee.

Fouls inside the penalty area
When a foul is committed by a defender inside the penalty area out of the
vision of the referee, especially if near to the AR’s position, the AR must first
make eye contact with the referee to see where the referee is positioned and
what action has been taken. If the referee has not taken any action, the AR must
signal with the flag, use the electronic beep signal and then visibly move down
the touchline towards the corner flag.
Fouls outside the penalty area
When a foul is committed by a defender outside the penalty area (near the
boundary of the penalty area), the AR should make eye contact with the
referee, to see the referee’s position and what action has been taken, and signal
with the flag if necessary. In counter-attack situations, the AR should be able
to give information such as whether or not a foul has been committed and
whether a foul was committed inside or outside the penalty area, and what
disciplinary action should be taken. The AR should make a clear movement
along the touchline towards the halfway line to indicate when the offence took
place outside the penalty area.
Laws of th e Game 2 019/20 | Prac tic al Guidelines for Matc h Offi c i a l s

211

Goal – no goal
When it is clear that the ball has wholly passed over the goal line in the goal,
the AR must make eye contact with the referee without giving any additional
signal.

 hen a goal has been scored but it is not clear whether the ball has passed
W
over the line, the AR must first raise the flag to attract the referee’s attention
and then confirm the goal.

Offside
The first action of the AR for an offside decision is to raise the flag (using the
right hand, giving the AR a better line of vision) and then, if the referee stops
play, use the flag to indicate the area of the field of play in which the offence
occurred. If the flag is not immediately seen by the referee, the AR must
maintain the signal until it has been acknowledged or the ball is clearly in the
control of the defending team.

Penalty kick
If the goalkeeper blatantly moves off the goal line before the ball is kicked and
a goal is not scored, the AR must raise the flag.
Substitution
Once the AR has been informed (by the fourth official or team official) that a
substitution is requested, the AR must signal this to the referee at the next
stoppage.
Throw-in
When the ball wholly passes over the touchline:

• n
 ear to the AR – a direct signal should be made to indicate the direction of
the throw-in
• far from the AR and the throw-in decision is an obvious one – the AR must
make a direct signal to indicate the direction of the throw-in
• far from the AR and the AR is in doubt about the direction of the throw-in
– the AR must raise the flag to inform the referee that the ball is out of play,
make eye contact with the referee and follow the referee’s signal

212

3. Additional assistant referees
The AARs use a radio communication system (not flags) to communicate with
the referee. If the radio communication system fails to work, the AARs will use
an electronic signal beep flagstick. AARs do not usually use obvious hand
signals but, in some instances, a discreet hand signal may give valuable support
to the referee. The hand signal should have a clear meaning and such signals
should be agreed in the pre-match discussion.
 he AAR, having assessed that the ball has wholly passed over the goal line
T
within the goal, must:

• immediately inform the referee via the communication system that a goal
should be awarded
• make a clear signal with the left arm perpendicular to the goal line pointing
towards the centre of the field (flagstick in the left hand is also required).
This signal is not required when the ball has very clearly passed over the
goal line.
The referee will make the final decision.

Laws of th e Game 2 019/20 | Prac tic al Guidelines for Matc h Offi c i a l s

213

Other advice
1. Advantage
The referee may play advantage whenever an offence occurs but should
consider the following in deciding whether to apply the advantage or stop play:
• t he severity of the offence – if the offence warrants a sending-off, the referee
must stop play and send off the player unless there is a clear opportunity to
score a goal
• the position where the offence was committed - the closer to the opponent’s
goal, the more effective the advantage can be
• the chances of an immediate, promising attack
• the atmosphere of the match

2. Allowance for time lost
Many stoppages in play are entirely natural (e.g. throw-ins, goal kicks).
An allowance is made only when delays are excessive.

3. Holding an opponent
Referees are reminded to make an early intervention and to deal firmly with
holding offences, especially inside the penalty area at corner kicks and free
kicks. To deal with these situations:

• t he referee must warn any player holding an opponent before the ball
is in play
• caution the player if the holding continues before the ball is in play
• a ward a direct free kick or penalty kick and caution the player if it happens
once the ball is in play

5. Treatment/assessment after a caution/sending-off
Previously, an injured player who received medical attention on the field of
play had to leave before the restart. This can be unfair if an opponent caused
the injury as the offending team has a numerical advantage when play restarts.
 owever, this requirement was introduced because players often unsportingly
H
used an injury to delay the restart for tactical reasons.
 s a balance between these two unfair situations, The IFAB has decided that
A
only for a physical offence where the opponent is cautioned or sent off, an
injured player can be quickly assessed/treated and then remain on the field of
play.

I n principle, the delay should not be any longer than currently occurs when a
medical person(s) comes on the field to assess an injury. The difference is that
the point at which the referee used to require the medical person(s) and the
player to leave is now the point at which the medical staff leave but the player
can remain.
 o ensure the injured player does not use/extend the delay unfairly, referees
T
are advised to:

• b
 e aware of the match situation and any potential tactical reason to delay the
restart
• inform the injured player that if medical treatment is required it must be
quick
• signal for the medical person(s) (not the stretchers) and, if possible, remind
them to be quick
When the referee decides play should restart either:

• t he medical person(s) leaves and the player remains or
• the player leaves for further assessment/treatment (stretcher signal may be
necessary)
 s a general guide, the restart should not be delayed for more than about
A
20–25 seconds beyond the point when everyone was ready for play to restart.
The referee must make full allowance for the stoppage.
